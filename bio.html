	<p>Alexandria is a senior at Tufts University double-majoring in International Relations and Political Science, with a concentration in national security and a minor in Mandarin Chinese. The former VP Finance and VP Operations for the Tufts Debate Society, Alexandria has spent three years as the Finance Director for the Alliance Linking Leaders in Education and the Services (ALLIES), a student-run think-tank focusing on civil-military relations, and is currently interning part-time for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. She is also the elected chair of the Tufts Community Union Judiciary, a branch of student government, and plays viola in the Tufts Symphony Orchestra.</p>

	<p>In her studies, Alexandria focuses on civil wars and judicial systems in post-civil war societies. She has professional proficiency in French and advanced proficiency in Mandarin Chinese, and speaks Modern Standard Arabic at a beginning level. She is passionate about learning and practicing languages, teaching debate to young audiences, and studying the defense acquisition process.</p>

	<p>A fun fact about Alexandria is that she never really grew out of her elementary-school space and rocks phase, and loves to visit the National Air and Space Musuem in Washington, DC and go on hikes to see local geological features.</p>
