I worked with Jonah Feldman (not in this course but a CS TA) to figure out some of my initial issues with git. The tl;dr was that I forgot to do git init in my local repository for this assignment, and as I tried to work through the problem I just dug myself deeper and deeper into a mysterious hole. Jonah helped me to troubleshoot, and, when fixing the problem proved a but involved, made sure when I deleted the repository and started over I used git init, git add, and git commit correctly.

This project took me roughly five to six hours to complete, including time spent with Jonah.
